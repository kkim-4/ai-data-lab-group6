Like SI sessions or TAs to help out.  \\n\\nNot sure. \\n\\nI think that the upper level classes could be more challenging. The bar is raised in organic chem, and then I feel like it is lowered again.  \\n\\nincrease the credit hour of p-chem lab, undergraduate research seminar \\n\\nThere needs to be an Organic chemistry lab section geared toward people who are not pre-med where we actually learn in depth how to perform the techniques used extensively in chemistry research. I think Organic Chemistry lab did not prepare me at all for research. Additionally, there needs to be an honors program established for the Chemistry Department because there is no reason why the chemistry department students who excel should receive less recognition than students in other departments. Professors advising undergraduate students in research should be well informed that there are different standards for undergraduates than there are for graduates. Undergraduate research is supposed to expose students to research and allow them to get some hands on experience, understanding that students are taking full class loads. From many of the students in the chemistry department whom I am have spoken to, their research experience at Emory has persuaded them against doing research because Professors were very demanding and it was extremely difficult for them to balance both undergraduate coursework and research.  \\n\\n- make things more structured (order of classes, more support) - hard to see application  \\n\\nI think mandating more math classes is helpful. Also, I know other departments have methods classes that helps teach some of the complex math. There is even a calculus class for biology majors. I think the department overall is OK. I think there is too little collaboration between professors about what was taught. That leads to grand assumptions that can greatly hinder learning.  \\n\\n1) ADVISING is BELOW POOR. From the start, the chemistry department at Emory did a far better job at DISCOURAGING me from obtaining a ChemBS than it did at ENCOURAGING me. I'm an Orgo SI leader, yet only 1 faculty member supported my decision to continue with the chemistry major after gen chem (thanks Dr. ****). NO faculty members supported my decision to switch from a BA to BS at the start of senior year. I did it anyway. I made it. 2) Chem 360 should be taken before Chem 331. I feel like several key concepts from 1st semester pchem are introduced in Chem360 in a more general, introductory manner. In 331, we are assumed to know things I didn't really understand until Dr. **** explained them a semester later in 360. 3) Pchem lab needs a COMPLETE restructuring. For starters, the lab PROFESSOR should be adept at MATHCAD manipulations relevant to the data calculations of which he/she is asking the STUDENT to perform for a GRADE. The 1st Lab lecture should be a MATHCAD tutorial. The other lectures should be restricted to essential, key concepts of the experiment (like Dr. **** lab lectures), not the mathematical derivations of the theories behind it(like Dr. **** lab lectures). The 1st lab of the year was kinetics and reaction rates. We didn't cover that in lecture until the last week of 2nd semester. It needs a total re-structuring.  \\n\\nsince basic lab sills are so important, there should be training geared towards professional lab etiquette and working with real protocols. I didn't master and become confident in my lab skills (making buffers, aseptic tech, following protocols) until I worked in an independent lab. The college does not offer this skill. \\n\\nI'm not sure \\n\\nget to know more students personally \\n\\nOverall great. Only one suggestion: make classes have more applicative learning styles for future problem solving like Dr. **** classes. \\n\\n-Stricter criteria for teaching of undergraduates, audit classes where there appears to be problems -nuclear chemistry  \\n\\nMake better electives, possibly things that show more applicability such as food science or the function of most used drugs, etc \\n\\nBuild as strong a connection between upper level labs and lectures as there are with general and organic labs. Encourage undergrads to go to the panels about careers in Chemistry \\n\\nBy coddling their majors like other departments do instead of leaving them to figure things out the hard way. \\n\\nI felt that many of the professors cared much more about their research than teaching undergraduates.

The chemistry department could lead the way in encouraging this path more and earlier. \\n\\n-The course revamps are GREAT--analytical, biochem, orgo lab, pchem lab. Keep doing that. (inorganic next??)  -Please please please put stronger lecturers on Biochem and Inorganic.  -PChem should be exciting!!! For example, in Modern Physics (which covers similar topics to 331), the many of the labs are nobel-prize winning experiments.   -Start lab reports--short and easy ones--from freshman or sophomore year (model how the physics dept does it with 151/152 and 253). It would help us as writers, scientists, and as non-whiners when we got to PChem.   -I love our professors! Almost everyone truly cares about undergrads and teaching, even many of the researchers, and it shows in the classes and in my grades.   -Remember there are non-premeds here!   -More female prof's would be awesome. \\n\\nPChem course should be taught by more eloquent professors. I would often become lost due to roundabout speech \\n\\nNext year, I think it would be nice if the career lectures were not at the same time as physical chemistry lab lecture. I think more events in the department would be great exposure to areas of research/what you can do with a chemistry degree. \\n\\nMake sure professors actually care about the material that they are required to teach. Decrease class size to 20 students per class. Include problem solving time during class. Emory students are very busy and often have conflicts with office hours. Find a way to teach more towards testing. Change your goal to helping students learn, and give them grades that reflect what they have learned instead of treating the classes like pre-med weed out courses. Give individual instructor feedback on problem solving before exams. \\n\\nAllowing more freedom in course choice and requirements \\n\\nI've had 7 different teachers in the chemistry department.  Two of them were very good and I've taken multiple classes of theirs because of this.  The other 5 were abysmal; the worst 5 teachers I've ever had.  As a result, I specifically avoided pursuing research in the chemistry department.   I also encourage prospective chemistry majors to find another area of science to study and most of my peers do the same.  If the department wants to seriously improve, then it needs to have at least some emphasis on quality teaching.  2 out of 7 is quite poor. \\n\\nThe best professor that I had while at Emory was Dr. **** for freshman orgo. I think it's generally true that the general chemistry and organic chemistry professors are the better professors in the chemistry department, largely because they care about the undergraduate class (granted there are exceptions, Dr. **** cares immensely about her students and is a wonderful professor, for example).  I've heard great reviews about other professors from graduate students about the graduate classes that they teach; however, when they teach an undergraduate class, it's rather obvious that the class is of little priority. My largest regret about the classes I've taken in the chemistry department is that I didn't take more graduate level chemistry classes. That being said, I'm not sure how that is remediable.   It would have also been nice if there were more electives to chose from within the major. The only other recommendation would be to highly encourage students to get involved in research. As I said above, working in lab was my favorite part of my undergraduate experience. This is the first time when all of the concepts and techniques finally connected and made sense. I came in thinking I was a pre-med, mainly because I wasn't sure what else to do. It wasn't until after joining a lab that I realized I would have hated med school and truly loved research instead. I know most pre-meds are single minded about being pre-med; but, I pretty sure there are others who would chose research over med school if they had the proper exposure. Lab classes don't provide an accurate portrayal of lab work, especially since most students associated taking a lab for class work as being a nuisance rather than a learning experience. \\n\\nMore research based lab course with fewer bottled experiments. \\n\\nIncrease the amount of equipment and laboratory techniques students are exposed to during lab courses. \\n\\nOne suggestion I would provide for the improvement of the department is to include a wider variety of courses for electives for the major that could relate chemistry to other fields of science. \\n\\nI don't think the upper level chemistry classes (after organic) are that well taught and I wish there were more options for those interested in organic chemistry.    Also Dr. **** should not teach biochemistry, it is incredibly boring, confusing, and frustrating. \\n\\nOffer the same SI system each week for classes like biochem, inorganic and pchem  With leaders who understand the material fully \\n\\nemphasize more teacher interaction \\n\\n*Make the labs more relevant to lecture/students' experience  *Revamp inorganic chemistry class/material  *Add more electives, especially those that make chemistry more applicable to real life (pharmaceutical chem/food chem/etc) \\n\\nlectures could improve to be more explicitly synchronized with the lecture content, more incentives or better screening of lecture professors, increased personal advisement and more structured and helpful large group advisement \\n\\nAdd a biochemistry major, or at least a biochemistry concentration to both the BS and BA degrees. \\n\\nNot applicable \\n\\nbetter advising for students \\n\\n- Assigning more caring-about-teaching professors to teach the core Chem courses   - Better TAs (who are more willing to be there to help and know what they are doing)  - Bring ChEmory closer to students, especially with more events (as well as announcements to represent their presence on campus) \\n\\ncreate more unity within the majors - didnt really know people outside my classes. that being said i didnt do chemory etc. \\n\\nMore diverse class options and more course opportunities. \\n\\nThe Chemistry Department should offer multiple classes of the same course. \\n\\nProfessors should have a more available range (and longer) of office hours and a larger library/classroom/hang out area for students and teachers to gather. \\n\\nThere should be more class  selection. At times, I felt limited and would have to wait till the following semester to fulfill an elective because the class selection was not great. \\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n1) amazing teachers in lower level chemistry classes made me pursue chemistry major  2) most of the faculty made connections during their classes and maintained them even after students were no longer in their classes, offering a support system for them as they moved forward in their college career \\n\\nFreshman organic chemistry  Biochemistry  Green Energy Chemistry \\n\\nDr. **** freshman organic chemistry class/advanced lab/SI sessions/his overall advising  Emory Chemistry in Italy Program  Chem 300 TA sessions \\n\\n-#1 hands down: seminar classes (Analysis of Art, Perspectives in Chemistry)  -getting to know our awesome professors in office hours and such  -learning fun and relevant stuff like how microwaves work, why my plastic cup changes color with temperature, etc \\n\\nUndergraduate Research    Graduate Level Courses    Speaking with Faculty \\n\\nLaboratory courses and research were very valuable, helping me to become comfortable with lab techniques.

Not on tenure. If professors don't want to teach, they shouldn't be teaching. Students deserve all the support and guidance from their professors. I realize that this model doesn't fit in well with the university's traditions and policies. Perhaps this needs a huge overhaul -- not just at Emory, but in universities everywhere. \\n\\nThe department should have info session on letting students know what do they need if they want to pursue a graduate school in chemistry. \\n\\nI think the biggest way in which the Chemistry department can improve is to show more concern for their students. The students who are fortunate enough to find a research position in the Department have several resources and feel very supported by the Department. However, for students who are unable to find a research position, there's little to not support. Several undergraduates have expressed their discouragement from the Department. Other undergraduate Departments on campus, such as NBB or Anthro, do a much better job of looking after their students. \\n\\nOffering more electives so we can explored topics that we are interested in. \\n\\nFocus on the teaching aspect, not research. Add new classes. Test students on what they not, not what they don't know. \\n\\nfix that atmospheric chemistry problem--it needs a new textbook, and Dr. **** doesn't really know how to teach/organise a class. She's really sweet though. \\n\\nI think my answer to this question goes back to my first answer about the experiences that I valued most. The chemistry department has very few courses that are offered as electives and that are cross-listed with other departments. I think this is a shame considering how important the study of chemistry is to other departments at this school, and it would serve the department and the students well to be forming those crucial relationships and connections to other departments/subjects that would improve the educational process and Emory's sense of community in the sciences as well. I'm not sure if this is already being considered by the department administration, but it would also serve the department well to offer students the chance to study on specific tracks (ex. Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Pharmacology, etc.) that would expand the reach of students beyond that of the relatively restrictive curriculum that is offered by the department right now. Overall, I do think that I received a well-rounded education by the chemistry department, but if I had a choice to major in a more specific aspect of chemistry, I most likely would have chosen to do that instead. \\n\\nDuring my time at Emory, the chemistry department offered a bunch of cool elective courses. I may have made a mistake by waiting until my final semester to take the elective, but, during that semester, the options were few and not too great. Perhaps, try to increase the consistency with which cool elective classes are offered (and the number of them). \\n\\nEncourage more students to partake in research and ways in which they can get involved within the chemistry department. As well, encourage more critical thinking of students (like **** does in Orgo) so that students can really grasp the ideas being taught. Most importantly, restructuring the lab system. The new p chem lab situation was great this semester! Encourage more problem solving labs in the future! \\n\\nDifferentiate between pre-medical and research focused chemistry majors. Graduate student mentoring. \\n\\nDon't make drastic changes to the curriculum (fusing classes together, especially orgo) More support/departmental advising for chem honors students writing thesis Add more electives (more than 1 or 2 a semester) Coordinate with the graduate school more--a lot of undergrad core classes are scheduled at the same time as grad classes \\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n \\n\\n1.

Making connections to other fields is essential, in my opinion, to bringing the course material together and being able to apply it in a real life setting.

Organic Chemistry Lecture: Orgo lecture often felt like a weed out class and an excuse to beat down student who weren't doing well. It's extremely discouraging to students, and many students across the college alter their career plans simply to not take organic chemistry. 2. Getting into the upper level undergraduate classes, students are taught by professors who make it abundantly clear that they are teaching simply to fulfill a tenure requirement and not because they actually want to be teaching. This attitude can be extremely disheartening for students who previously in 100 and 200 level chemistry classes had extremely engaging and dynamic professors. 3. I became a chem major for physical chemistry, but I couldn't actually take physical chemistry until my senior year because I didn't come into Emory with AP Credit. I think the Department could change the curriculum to allow for further specializations/concentrations so that students who are more interested in physical chemistry aren't forced to sit through biochemistry and other classes which are simply hoops to jump through. \\n\\ndifficulty of access to chemistry literature \\n\\nBiochemistry - this course was taught by Dr. **** during the Fall 2013 semester, and I did not learn very much (if anything at all) from the course, which would have been very interesting and essential to my future career goals as a health professional.

They are dull and uninspiring. The flipped classroom attempt by Dr. ****was noble but wildly unsuccessful. The lecture by Dr. ****, though a lecture, didn't have a textbook and the study material was a series of poorly organized and laid out files on canvas. In addition, the vertical posters hanging from those clips are ineffective and look messy and unprofessional. Many posters don't work in a vertical format and would benefit from a horizontal format. I miss the old rolling poster boards that we would put the posters on. In addition, I feel that many of the upper level classes in the chemistry department (CHEM350, CHEM331/332, etc) are taught by professors that would be better off doing research than trying to teach undergraduates. It is obviously not their priority (by the level of effort put into the class) and the undergraduates don't learn as much as they should in these courses. I do not feel comfortable in the topics of pchem or inorganic chem and do not look forward to the entrance exams for graduate school, as it will fully display my lack of background in these areas. \\n\\nprovide a biochemistry major that involves less physical and inorganic chemistry, this would speak to a lot of people's interests do not assign faculty advisees if they are not committed \\n\\nMore resources for chemistry majors specifically, such as how to get involved with research.

I loved my first two years of chemistry which is why I declared the major. I have frankly disliked the rest of the courses I have taken because the professors have been awful because they do not care about teaching. Also, Dr. ****is sexist and the department does not seem to care about all the sexism there is. Even in the awards, many girls had highest honors and did not win research awards, while males with high honors did. It is really challenging to be a woman in this department and I regret my choice of major. The department is not welcoming to anyone who does not fit the mold of a typical chemistry major and I would not encourage any females to major in chemistry because it has been a bad experience. While I am committed to graduate school, I am seriously considering not attending because I do not want to deal with another inappropriate department as this one. Also, the department does not tenure women which is also discouraging to women in science. Had I known how bad the quality of teaching was as I got to higher level classes and the lack of electives I would have transferred to a different school. Also, the ChemMentor award should NOT have been given to the same person two years in a row. This department is detached and does not pay attention to who is actually doing good work. Also, by rewarding those who are sexist and antisemetic the chemistry department has encouraged these things to continue. My last note is that those who were nominated for awards and didn't get any should be notified because many people did not know they would have been notified and showed up to be disappointed. I am truly hopeful that the department becomes for encouraging of women in the sciences in the future. While this is likely the end of my chemistry journey I hope other women are encouraged as opposed to made feel uncomfortable for their gender.  \\n\\n \\n\\nthere is very little guidance and advising in this department which I am very dissatisfied  \\n\\n \\n\\nThere aren't very many chemistry electives offered each semester and are typically out of four options (organometallics, atmospheric chemistry, biochemistry 2, or special topics). I would have loved to see more interdisciplinary electives (possibly cross-listed with other departments to ensure a high demand) such as astrochemistry, green chemistry, nuclear chemistry, quantum chemistry, analysis of ancient art, chemical neuroscience, etc.  Also, I think it would be very valuable for those who declare a chemistry major to attend a seminar discussing how to get involved with the chemistry department. It could cover getting involved with a professor's lab, becoming a TA, tutoring, summer internships, graduate school, career paths beyond just graduate school, how to prepare for writing an honors thesis, etc. This could encourage more involvement with the chemistry department and get students to start thinking of these things early on rather than trying to find all this information on their own.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI took the old-school genchem/orgo sequence, so I cannot speak to improving given the new core sequence that I am unfamiliar with.   However, our professors understanding that we (most of us) are coming into Chemistry knowing little to nothing, and teaching us from the understanding that we know very little about what they are talking about would be very helpful. Also, teaching things one way in genchem, only to unteach all those things as \\\"not quite right\\\" later on is not helpful. I would prefer to gain a more complete understanding of a thing rather than a poor and incomplete understanding of several things.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNone  \\n\\n \\n\\nYour curriculum is not the problem. Offer more electives. Why don\\u2019t all of your faculty teach undergraduates? Everyone in biology does even Bruce Levin in the National Academy of Sciences does. None of the chemistry faculty are in the NAS so I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re too good to do it.  If the bio department can teach grads and undergrads so can chem. There\\u2019d be more electives this way. Also tell Dr. ****he isn\\u2019t the most cited professor at Emory. ****is. I don\\u2019t think Dr. ****is even the most cited in the college. It puts people off, especially students.   Perhaps consider that medical/graduate schools have taken the focus off of just admitting good students with good grades and now want superhumans instead of students as applicants. Students can\\u2019t focus on studying when graduate and medical programs want them to cure cancer, volunteer at hospitals, shadow, do research and save the Earth. It\\u2019s a systematic issue that a curriculum change won\\u2019t fix.   Analytical should be two semesters. It\\u2019s the most practical chemistry class and Dr. ****is great, who cares if students complain about it being boring? Students having practical chemistry skills including instrumentation is imperative.  \\n\\n \\n\\nYou need to actually prepare students for working in an industry instead of going on to academia. I tried to do an internship for credit and that wasn\\u2019t available how is that possible ????? It\\u2019s frustrating to study science at such a top tier institution and feel like the only thing it prepared  \\n\\nyou for was medicinal school or academic research. I am very confused as to why the Chem department at emory doesn\\u2019t have any connections - and if they do they are not promoted- to any scientific industry that would be valuable connections to graduating seniors.  \\n\\n \\n\\nProviding more electives at the undergraduate level for students interested in areas outside of the current offerings. Make courses like Chemical Biology and Physical Chemistry Lab required courses! All chemistry students should be proficient in the skills taught in these courses before graduating.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMore electives. Don't let **** teach freshmen  \\n\\n \\n\\nMore support for students struggling in upper level chemistry courses. I feel like there are a lot of resources available to students struggling in general and organic chemistry, but I really needed help in physical chemistry and found I had very little resources.  \\n\\n \\n\\n1) More variety of classes.

The information was there if I looked through the prereqs, but I would have to look through prereqs a year or two in advance of when I would take the chemistry course so that I could plan to take physics and math on time I think motivated students should be encouraged to take upper level courses earlier in their education. I felt that I was discouraged from jumping up into pchem but it would\\u2019ve allowed me to take more than one graduate course which I would\\u2019ve wanted to do.  \\n\\nI think that the chemistry's department decision to overhaul the program and develop a more integrated approach to the chemistry major was a spectacular idea, I personally wish I could have experienced the new major program. I believe that the laboratory courses might be better off if their importance is emphasized more in the intro classes. I also believe that the department can improve by offering more options to students who are interested in a specific field of chemistry and would benefit from avoiding placing all students in a cookiecutter major track. For example, instead of forcing somebody is interested in upper-level biochemistry to take inorganic chemistry classes perhaps there should just be an \\\"Advanced Topics in Chemistry Requirement\\\" that must be fulfilled.  \\n\\n-more departmental events -more pre-med relevant electives (sim to med chem, biochem) -option to get BS without calculus heavy pchem (i.e. BS in biochem) -more collaboration with other departments/interdisciplinary courses More computational chemistry with application to proteins.  \\n\\n \\n\\nLess emphasis on tests and more on understanding a concept for the sake of knowledge.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFind more professors that are genuinely interested in their students\\u2019 success and concerned with the knowledge they gain from taking their course.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe new curriculum still has to be tweaked a bit, listen to the students, professors, and TA's about how and where these tweaks should be made.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI preferred the old structure of the first four semesters. When I took those courses, they had the old structure of two semesters of General, two of Organic. Now, I TA for Chem 203/204 for Dr. ****, and I think the new structure, while perhaps more engaging/interesting for students interested in biology/health sciences, covers less Chemistry than did the old structure. The students are learning less about Organic chemistry than ever before, and I am concerned that they'll be less interested in organic synthesis (which is my favorite topic), or that the pre-medical students will perform worse on the MCAT due to having a less deep knowledge base in Organic.  \\n\\nletting prof ****teach more classes, he is great.  offer more sections of core classes!!!!!!!!!!! why is pchem only taught by one professor at one section if it is need to graduate? - have a wider range of electives  \\n\\n \\n\\nConverting to department of Cat-mistry for real not just April fools.

Everyone is so motivating and the commitment to fostering young scientists is very apparent. I think it would be really useful for more awareness of the different types of research opportunities available (perhaps a seminar where professors talk to potential students or even a rotation program for course credit that models grad. student rotations). This way even sophomores are aware of physical and inorganic chemistry opportunities that I only truly discovered in my last year.  \\n\\nMake sure future students who want to go to grad school for chemistry take pchem lab with writing to help them learn how to write scientifically.

I know many professors are interested in teaching classes that might be more niche and not as enticing to all. And I think this would allow people with a bit more elective freedom, and make the classes more intimate. I would also propose creating a computational chemistry elective course. One thing that I feel slightly underprepared in is using computational programs to design my own models. I think offering a course that introduces the basics of computations such as DFT calculations would be incredibly valuable. Especially because chemistry research is becoming increasingly reliant on these types of computations.\\nProviding a support system for undergrads who want to do research. For the travel grants: providing money upfront for students, rather than reimbursement. Developing student socials for undergrad chem majors and grad students, so we can all network in a low-key setting.\\n\\nPhysical chemistry lecture was horrible. Math was too complicated \\nAlthough there's nothing you guys can do about it now, the way you all handled the transition from the old curriculum to the new one was terrible. Instead of giving students on the old curriculum a chance to devote more time to each of their classes, many students had to double or even triple up on three hard sciences in more than one semester. This resulted in many students doing poorly in those classes because they didn't have enough time. I don't understand why certain courses couldn't've been offered for at least one more year as newer students wouldn't've been able to take them anyway. I had to reschedule my last two years at Emory because you guys decided to cut 260 a year before my class even graduated and Chemistry isn't even my primary major! Luckily, my love for Chemistry pushed me to continue taking classes, but I wasn't happy with the way you guys handled the transition at all. \\n\\n\\\"What it really comes down to is clear, consistent social responsibility. You have a responsibility to your students to teach more critically, to include more about climate science earlier on, to discuss the real life social implications of the pharmaceutical industry. Most of all you have a responsibility to ensure your faculty members are acting with integrity and treating their students fairly - not based on race or gender. The number of times I have heard about (micro)agressions in the chemistry classroom from women, from people of color, makes me shudder. \\\"\\\"It's fine, it be like that sometimes,\\\"\\\" is not what we should have to say. A half day bias training is not going to cover it. We need sustained engagement on this front, a 1-credit class or something similar.  \\n\\nAside from this, we are behind on Green Chemistry research and curriculum. As you look towards new hires, make this a priority.\\\"\\nI think the department is trending in the right direction and am excited to see what happens with the new curriculum. I would encourage you to keep it going and make adjustments as needed, but overall the chemistry department is doing a great job in my opinion.\\nMandatory meetings per semester with our advisor to just check our progress and ask questions. \\njust listening to students and peers about unwanted change\\nImprove quality of teaching\\n- More fun laboratory experiments!\\nDon't do the new curriculum\\n\\nI see that the unbound curriculum is potentially adding a Biochemistry track which I think would be good. \\n\\\"The professors within the same course (gen.chem, orgo, etc.) should communicate with one another by the spread of grades, examination styles, and class sizes. Professors determined the grades and scared many students from pursuing chemistry courses.\\nLECTURE PROFESSORS AND LAB PROFESSORS SHOULD KNOW WHAT EACH COURSE IS TEACHING. A common problem in the departments like Chemistry and Biology is the disconnect between material in the lab versus in the lecture. Labs are at the disadvantage of not being able to meet with students consistently throughout the week and teach certain material. Labs should be a place of experiencing and practicing what is being learned in lecture at a superior and more practical level. This opportunity for me was wasted but I do believe it can be fixed as long as professors between lecture and lab communicate effectively.\\nFor chemistry majors wanting to take physical chemistry, I believe a linear algebra and multivariable background is absolutely necessary. I fortunately took both courses pass/fail during my fourth year and wished I took them sooner as mathematical concepts and derivations within physical chemistry became much clearer. In addition, I made friendships with people who have not seen a derivative since high-school. I understand the chemistry major consists of many credits but the physical chemistry professors should provide some external review session to go over the mathematical background these courses require. This would make an extreme impact on the learning of physical chemistry topics and assist especially in the first semester of particle in a box models.\\\"\\nImproving teaching labs to be more organized and clear to the students\\nDoing great!\\nWhile the chemistry department prepares students to pursue PhD and MD, the department could provide more resources on employment after graduating with BA/BS. I wish there were co-op programs and networking events with people outside academia (industry, government, etc.).\\n\\nMore advising maybe. Make mandatory check ups each semester or something like that. \\noffer more summer abroad programs! the chemistry in italy program with **** and **** was AMAZING everyone should have a great experience like that\\nPlease look at previous answer.\\nYour researchers are fantastic. However, there are a few instances of teaching, particularly with the entrance level classes, that are inadequate. Perhaps co-teaching, increasing the number of professionals that the students encounter early on? More focus on scientific writing. During my time at Emory, I was called on to write a few literature reviews, two proposals, 8 lab write ups and the occasional explanation of a scientific process. Unfortunately, 85% of these were confined to one class, namely Physical Chemistry labs. Although my writing capabilities grew throughout the course, I would feel much more prepared if this writing emphasis was increased and spread across the multiple years I had been there.\\nBetter classes, more \\\"human\\\" professor student interactions, and better ways for students to not feel as though they are competing against each other in the classroom setting.\\nmore electives \\n\\n\\nprovide a greater number of electives offered at different days/times. I often found that a chemistry elective i would like to take coincided with a required course for the major. Also provide clear descriptions of these elective courses. \\nOne of the things that inspired me the most, and made me truly start to enjoy chemistry, was participating in guest lectures by renown chemists or biologists. I wished I had known about the numerous ongoing lectures during each week before my junior year, so that I could have immersed myself early in the experience.\\nGive more assignments and chances for a student to improve their grade. And stop teaching topics that aren\\u2019t going to be tested. Teach so I don\\u2019t have to go teach myself afterwards\\nN/A\\n\\n\\nn/a\\n\\nAllow more flexibility in classes required for the major. I felt I had no say in which classes I wanted to take except for the one elective course required for the BA. In addition, there were not many options for elective courses that interested me, so it would've been nice to have more variety in terms of the elective courses.\\nI'm not entirely sure how the new curriculum is structured, so I do not have any comments on that end. At least on the old curriculum, I feel that Chemistry was not really interdisciplinary until you hit Biochem and Pchem. I think that an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of Chemistry would have helped me take more relevant classes in my undergraduate years, like more Physics classes. \\nmy only complaint was having a lot of difficulty finding a lab position.

Also, in research - not learning how to use a mass spectrometer. One of the most common questions I got on graduate school interviews was if I have experience taking mass spectra (that is a big thing in the discipline I am going into). While I am relatively comfortable examining the data, if my prospective PI was to ask me to take a mass spectrum, I would not be able to do it (or figure it out). Dr. **** is great and amazingly helpful, but learning how to use the instrumentation would have been a very valuable experience.\\\"\\n\\\"Chemistry is chemistry, it is going to be very challenging and I can't complain. \\n\\nSome of the professors were too focused on their research than the students so it was hard for me to interact with them and attend office hours.

I felt that the general chemistry lab was an excellent opportunity to practice use of tools and experience the science first hand. Unfortunately the course was aimless at times with many technical issues through canvas and did not enrich my experience when studying and applying chemistry. Organic chemistry lectures should help bring a bigger picture to the reactions being learned and help teach students how to construct pathways. Organic Chemistry lecture was more of a mandatory waste of time due to it adding no more to the learning experience than simply reading the book would. I do not mean to be insulting nor do I know how to fix this problem. I do ask that the organic chemistry lecture be taught in a way that is not wordy by word of the text book and more of a lab where teachers can demonstrate students how to think about pathways to help develop a \\\"chemical intuition\\\" for chemical problems. Inorganic chemistry was taught by an extremely intelligent professor and brought great area of chemistry to light but the course did not reflect the examinations. A whole topic could be spent over 20 minutes of discussion and yet not make it to the exam. I do encourage professors to illustrate the greater picture of certain topics but during the class I did feel lost at times even when devoting 100% of my attention during the course. My success in exams were determined by the luck of focusing on the correct material that made it to the exam.\\nGeneral Chemistry Lab (141L and 142L)\\n\\\"Chem 141/142 Lab with Dr. ****\\nPhysical Chemistry with Dr. **** was pretty dry\\n\\\"\\nlack of elective courses, but i checked the chemistry courses for fall 2020 and see that there are now interesting elective courses.

I know it might be strange, but I prefer group office hours than scheduled one-on-one office hours. I would love it for more professors to be available regular, group office hours because I like hearing the questions of my classmates. Even just listening in helps me to better understand the material. I felt that, as I got into the upper level classes, there were less regular office hours and more scheduled one-on-one office hours.\\n\\nI'm not sure on many other invaluable experiences I had.

This is very important for helping students feel like they can speak openly and be mentored in a way that meets their career goals. An inspirational mentor is not the same thing as a good advisor. \\n\\\"\\nBeing the first year in the unbound curriculum, there were not as many biology-related chemistry classes available. In fact, there were no Chemistry LW classes offered in the semester I was free to take it, so I had to change my BS to a BA. Not to mention that the classes that did exist or come into fruition were unplanned.\\nMore open discussions on diversity in the department.

Dr. Kindt a times try to take away the math but at times that made it even more confusing. Another improvement is that there are many topics in general chemistry that are missed in the unbound ciriculum that are commonly tested on the MCAT and other entrance exams. For example redox chemistry, galvanic and electrolytic chemistry, certain topics in thermodynamics. These topics were not taught but we were taught multiple times stereochemistry and did organic chemistry practically for 3.5 semesters.  \\nall good all good\\nAllocating more resources and time to get more students ahead. Addressing the fact that very few of the same students repeatedly win all awards handed by the department.\\nI think more hands-on advising early on in the University would be helpful. Either having us declare our majors earlier on, or just having us meet with an advisor as a mandatory thing early on. \\n\\nMake classes more interactive. Don't expect students to teach themselves the material from the textbooks! The teachers are supposed to teach us, and the textbooks should be for backup!\\nI have seen incremental improvements with the upcoming students in the chemistry sequence. I would say that the labs could directly connect more to the lecture such as the way Chem 204L with Professor **** achieved as well as Dr. **** with Chem 205L. I could barely see a link between the 150, 202, and 203 info presented in lab along with the lecture material. \\nSee above\\nMore exposure to chemistry fields and topics in intro classes. \\n\\nThe way Dr. **** formatted his entry level classes was very different and hard for me. This format while it works for some did not work for me. I much preferred how Dr. **** taught and did much better with his teaching style. \\n\\nHave more direct connections between gen chem lab and class. Where the schedules are more closely aligned and adapted.\\n\\nContinue with the course of excellence and transformation that has defined the department over the 47 years since I enrolled.  When I first set foot in the THEN new Chemistry department in 1974 and returned again to set foot in the NOW new Chemistry department in 2000, it literally took my breath away.

Faculty suggested getting involved in research immediately, taking less courses, plan on going to grad school right out of undergrad, but grad students/graduates advised building a stronger foundation in coursework and taking time to decide whether grad school is the right option. While I enjoyed my research experience, I think that sophomore year should have been more focused on building foundational knowledge. It was a difficult balance of important coursework and an independent, largely unsupervised research project.)\\n - Mental Health: Working on an independent research project means spending many hours alone performing repetitive tasks. I think that there should be more chemistry-centric resources to help students learn to manage rumination/other negative, unforeseen side effects that can arise from this type of work, especially when they think it is necessary to get through such projects to have a chance at graduate school. \\n- Transparency: My advisor (pre-major and then major) left during the summer of my junior year, and I was not informed of his leaving. I only found out based on an off-hand comment at a research group meeting. \\\"\\n\\\"1. The confusing way that physical/quantum chemistry was taught (CHEM 205) was awful, especially since the professor would try to explain multivariable calculus concepts to a class of students who barely understand regular calculus. Visualizing quantum chemistry concepts are extremely difficult, and I was never able to fully understand what was happening in that class.\\n2. One of my lab professors (Dr. **** in CHEM 202L) taught us about crystals and expected us to know how transition metals like iron bonded while we barely understood how carbon bonded with anything. It was confusing since we were expected to know more than what made sense at our education level of chemistry.\\n3. I have severe test anxiety, so chemistry tests were the worst experiences of my life, especially since some chemistry classes relied only on our test grades for our final grade in the class (ex.

My major advisor was absent most of the time and I had a lot of issues because I began in the old curriculum, took a year off, and came back to a lot fewer class options. I had to fight for answers every semester about whether or not I was on the right path with my courses. Finding the right courses to be able to graduate on time was extremely difficult under my circumstances.  \\n\\\"1. The worksheets done in class early on in the chem sequence with limited lecture time were not the best for 150 and 202 even though you wanted to encourage collaboration. Sometimes, I would sit there confused and would fill the sheet in incorrectly if there are no TAs available. \\n2. Chem 202 with Professor **** barely had any structure and was quite frankly useless working with crystals.\\n3. Excessive amounts of work for Chem Lab courses in 203 with ****. It was stressful and unnecessary to understand what was being taught in lecture. \\\"\\n\\\"1. Advising -- I felt like my advisor did not care about me as an individual or as a student. Sometimes our advising conversations would not last more than 5 minutes.\\n2. CHEM 301 -- I understand what the chemistry department is trying to achieve in this course, and I think that although that is important, there are still a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. Aside from the particular paper my group presented on in class, I did not feel like I learned a thing in that class.\\n3. CHEM 203L - I'm not sure what the labs are like now, but whenever I was in this class, I remember spending more time on the post-lab assignments than on any other assignments for the other courses I was in.

I feel like if there were more open positions in chem faculty labs, then I could've gotten more in depth research, earlier on, and had closer relationships with PI for recommendation for grad school. This is biggest problem in my opinion.\\\"\\r\\nOffering more classes. Some classes required for the major were difficult to get in and conflicted with scheduling for other classes.

Helping students decide what they can do with a chem major if they don't want to go to med school or grad school (because there are tons of options and i figured them out on my own). more cross listed electives, like environmental science and chemistry doing a clean energy elective or the art history and chemistry department doing an art restoration elective. i also think your experience depended so much on who your professors were (like **** vs. **** vs. ****). potentially improving standardization across the classes could be helpful both for gpa consistency and foundational knowledge in later course. obviously our college experience was extremely impacted by covid and most of our major classes were online which was very sad in terms of making connections with professors and other research opportunities. i love my friends in the chem major and without them i would have had a really hard time. \\r\\n\\\"I think the \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153core\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d sequence of CHEM150-CHEM205 was organized and taught very well, but the elective courses didn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t meet my expectations. This is likely primarily due to COVID induced distance learning (I took all my 300 level electives online), but I felt like there was never much real content being covered. Courses like Quantum Mechanics and Inorganic chemistry contained significant amounts of review instead of discussing new ideas. \\n\\nAlso, I think the department should require more math courses for the chemistry major.

There needs to be a much stronger focus on mentorship, and actively getting students from all backgrounds interested in research or helping them get access to tools they can use when they graduateb\\r\\nTell Dr. **** to grade accurately\\r\\n\\r\\nimprove mentorship \\r\\nUnify chem 205. If is so difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have loved my experience here so much and would not change it in any way! I think enthusiasm for chemistry will continue to draw prospective chemistry majors in :)\\r\\nbetter mentorship, more funding for labs, more research positions, feedbacks from students for a class\\r\\n\\r\\nPromoting communication between graduate students and undergrads\\r\\nMake labs even more informative and exciting, teach organic chemistry with a special emphasis on doing problems in class, and alter Chem 205!\\r\\n\\\"1) Advertise or educate students better on the different tracks within the chemistry major. I did not know that an ACS-certified degree was separate until fall of my senior year!!!!!! This seems like something that should have been very valuable to know and possibly pursue but I didn't even realize that the B.S. degree I was receiving was not even up to ACS standards! I appreciate the focus on Chem Unbound but I think that it's detrimental to students if this other component gets left behind.\\n2) More elective options. For two semesters in a row now, I was left with no choice but to take classes that I was simply not interested in because I had already taken all the electives they were offering or something didn't fit my schedule (more on that later). For elective classes, I was talking to a friend in NBB who said she has so many different choices she doesn't know what to take, I wish that was my problem! I am most engaged when I'm taking classes that are of interest to me and taking three semesters' worth of physical chemistry has been a bit of a struggle.\\n3) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO BETTER WITH CLASS AND LAB SCHEDULES FOR ATHLETES! Student-athlete chem majors are few and far between and I believe a huge part of that is that class scheduling is terrible for those of us who play sports. Scheduling multiple sections of major requirement classes in the afternoons means we are forced to miss 1-2 afternoon practices a WEEK (something that peers in other majors often only have to deal with one semester if at all)! Additionally, every other department has evening labs, something that is helpful to those of us who are busy in the afternoons with practice. I have talked to professors who bemoaned the lack of student-athletes in class, and I totally agree with them and wish that this major was something more accessible to all, please help us make that possible!\\\"\\r\\nAdvertise about guest lecturers more \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be honest, it needs a complete overhaul that doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t cause teachers to prioritize their research over the education of students. If the chemistry department really wants to improve, then they have a long road ahead of them. \\r\\nmake sure the professors are interested in teaching \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease make it easier for Oxford continuees to get into research at Emory college\\r\\nMake it easier\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBe more organized with the materials learned in different sections of the same class, inspect some classes that are too heavy in workload\\r\\nI feel like I didn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t learn everything I would have in the standard two semesters of physical chemistry, although I learned parts of it in various electives\\r\\nMy suggestion would perhaps be to please expand the scope of physical chemistry offerings, if possible. The 331 and 332 sequence was notoriously challenging but drilling into that content would be interesting, I think. From my understanding 370: Quantum Chemistry extends on 205 but from what I have heard it doesn't yet go into the depth of 331/332.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvide a wider array of lab courses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courses provided by the department should focus more on preparing students with solid knowledge of chemistry in an organized way. Though interdisciplinary learning does have some benefits, students tend to get lost when they fail to see an apparent connection/continuity of the concepts they learn across different semesters.\\r\\nI wish the chemistry department were a little more integrated/interdisciplinary, it sometimes feels evident that there isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t a lot of communication between professors. I wish we focused on more big-picture conclusions in class sometimes\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd more electives that are interdisciplinary with other departments or are about niche subjects that professors choose. Have more networking events for chemistry majors to meet each other. \\r\\n\\r\\nHire competent teachers who enjoy teaching not just research\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficult and rigor of the lower level classes really discourages chemistry majors from pursuing the track. I personally really loved chemistry and was inspired by professor in high school who encouraged me to pursue it in college, but the chemistry department itself is hard to work with and get accommodations from even if you are in the major. Personally, I would\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ve preferred separate classes from students only taking chemistry for the pre-med requirements, and different sections for students seriously considering declaring the major. \",\n          \"Research, TA\\n\\\"1.

We get to make cool things\\n\\n\\nMore diversity in stafff and more advising \\n\\nI think the inorganic department could be expanded, obviously Emory is very focused on organic chemistry and biochemistry for medicine but as a student who is more interested in inorganic and physical chemistry the elective offerings and research opportunities in those areas could be better. I also think that it's more difficult for Oxford continuees to join research labs at Emory main campus because they haven't had the same amount of time to build personal relationships or take classes with professors that they would be interested in researching with as students who only study at the main campus.\\nThe chemistry department can improve first by better standardizing the courses within the sequence (i.e. fall vs spring 204 and 202z vs 202). \\nThe Chemistry department can improve in many ways, starting with its introspection at how it hires professors based on prestige rather than by hiring based on candidates that can offer the support students need to succeed. It is unacceptable that there are not enough BIPOC professors in the department who can help support BIPOC students and offer mentorship. There is no reason that I always have to be the only Latine student in a class of 50+ students. The requirements for studying abroad are also not inclusive of first-gen students, how is a department that receives millions in funding not able to allocate a scholarship for under-resourced students who want to immerse themselves in experiential chemistry learning? Although I have offered my thoughts on ways this department has failed First-Generation, Low-income, BIPOC students --I will take time to applaud professors in the department who genuinely want to make this department into a community and who make staying in the major worth it. Overall, my experience in this department has been good because of the professors who care about celebrating identity and recognize nontraditional learning approaches like Dr. ****, Dr. ****, and Dr. **** (to name a few).  \\nThe chemistry department is great, I would only suggest more class offerings especially for 300+ level elective courses. \\nPlease make the new oxford kids feel more welcome and show them where things are in the lab!\\nprovide a refresher list of concepts before every course so that students are better prepared for the course. \\n\\n\\n\\\"1) I would like to see more professors that are Jewish. I am Jewish and I have not taken a single chemistry class with a single professor that shares this identity.\\n2) I think Chem 205 should be integrated better into the curriculum.\\\"\\n\\\"Have a more diverse set of courses and have more support for people not going to medical school. As someone planning to go to graduate school, I felt as though there was very little support for me (except Dr. **** who was amazing of course) but the chem department as a whole did not offer much support for prospective graduate students. \\nIn addition, I feel like the courses offered all centered around biochemistry and organic, and all had a very large premed focus. While I understand Emory is a large premed school, it would be nice if there were more inorganic, PChem, computational, and analytical classes offered. \\\"\\n\\n\\nFix the curriculum. Unbound is a joke and doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t work. I like Pchem and learned more pchem/physics outside of the department than in the department. Make all majors take phys 151/152, more math and maybe even create a thermo class (**** class is somewhat close, but mainly taken my bio people who don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t like people which cares off ppl interested in thermo).\\nCan CHEM 204 lecture materials be taught at the same time? And can we have CHEM 204L labs follow what we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re actually learning in class?\\nNeeds to be more accessible to students with disabilities. Correct the amount of time for the credit hours, as labs are way more work than 2 credits. The amount of time put in by every student is way over the amount of work for any other 2 credit course. The professors should be flexible and understanding when there are extenuating circumstances. There needs to be a collaborative environment in the chemistry department between students and it should be evaluated consistently throughout the semester. Please offer more courses not just for students who are pre-med because it truly takes away from what we can be learning. \\n\\n\\nBetter elective offering \\n\\nI couple of more electives on different niche topic would be very cool, sort of like the color lab that is very specific.  And more information for the chem majors that are not pre-med\\nBetter advisors! And more evident care towards students. While I received emails from professors in other departments after the events on campus in the past weeks, the only one I received from the chem department was rescheduling this survey and test with no mention to our health or safety. I understand it can be awkward but the lack of message from the department or acknowledgment that anything was even happening felt off. \\nNot a clue. You guys are very sweet; chemistry is just hard.\\nAdd more real world examples and applications to the lecture classes + focus on problem solving rather than yes/no or true/false questions on exams. I loved the Chemistry major at Emory it has been foundational to my future success and I truly believe it is probably the best STEM degree program at Emory  \\nThe chemistry department needs more electives and more options, given the somewhat rigid and sequenced structure of the major. Additionally, not all professors exhibit stellar teaching and this should be aggressively managed to ensure student learning.\\nLabs are only 2 credits why are they so much work\\n\\nMore elective courses in a wider range of topics. More availability for core courses and labs. \\n\\nI think there should be more cohesiveness between different semesters and professors of the same course. There should also be more cohesiveness between z-track and regular track content. I wish the chemistry department would do more to celebrate its graduating seniors as well.\\n\\nmake chem 205 more consistent\\n300L needs to be either I. Easier or II. More credit hours. Loved the class and Dr. ****,  but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a lot more work than 2 credits, and can be overwhelming if you build your schedule without that knowledge. Also 204 needs to be more standardized, seems everyone had different 204 content. Also maybe some emotional intelligence and empathy training for pre-meds lol.\\nInvolve more student-to-student learning curriculums. \\nI would like more class options and for a change in some of the staff. I've had some of the best but also some of the worst professors in my college career at the Chem Building. \\nI often feel like the chemistry department is in a bubble, I think getting out of that bubble can make it feel more inviting. \\n\\\"Increase supportiveness of all students and learning styles among faculty and thus increase professional behavior among faculty\\nIncrease transparency about classes so that students understand what they are signing up for (perhaps publish old syllabi to course atlas)\\\"\\nI believe we can create more resources for students of color who are prospective Chemistry majors. Creating a support system among Black Chemistry major alumni with incoming students would be helpful. I also believe that there should be more incentive, besides succeeding academically, for students to become Learning Assistants. \\nmore community bonding/events \\nI know this is nearly impossible as of now, but more standardization of foundational classes. Also, recommending (or honestly just requiring) students to take calc 1 and 2 --and maybe the first physics course-- before 205.\\n\\n\\nencourage students to join chemory in main track classes! (150, 202z, 202, etc.) I feel they provide a lot of good opportunities that many chem majors miss out on.
